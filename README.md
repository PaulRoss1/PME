## Description

A web application for browsing upcoming music events in Prague. The web application consists of an interactive map which displays markers for each event, a filtering system, a page dedicated to each event with additional information and a shopping cart sytem.

I made this application as a practice project to improve my React.js skills. The project has three main parts, a [web scraper](https://github.com/PaulRoss1/PME-Scraper) that collects data on events and saves the data to a MySQL database. A [REST API](https://github.com/PaulRoss1/PME-API) made with the Django REST Framework. And the [frontend](https://github.com/PaulRoss1/PME-Frontend) made using React.js.
